EXECUTION OF THE PROBLEMS SYSTEM DESIGN:

GET A PARTICULAR TEST CASE -> GET USER CODE -> SEND THE USER CODE WITH THE PARTICULAR TEST CASE TO THE API PROVIDER WHICH RUNS THE CODE
-> NOW THE EXECUTION PROCESS CONSISTS OF THREE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES:
                                                        1.EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY
                                                        2.EXECUTION FAILED (ERROR)
                                                        3.EXECUTION LIMIT (IT HIT A LIMIT OF FEW SECONDS TO EXECUTE SO WE IMMEDIATLY RETURN THAT SO WE DO NOT OVERWHELM THE MONACO-API)
IF EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY, GET THE OUTPUT AND COMPARE THE OUTPUT WITH OUR OUTPUT THAT WE HAVE SAVED IN THE DATABASE,
PUT THE OUTPUTS INTO AN ALGORITHM FOR DETECTING IF THE OUTPUTS MATCH, IF THE OUTPUTS HAPPEN TO MATCH THEN JUST RETURN TRUE (THE EXECUTION WAS SUCCESSFUL)
ELSE RETURN FALSE (THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS IN THE CODE).


SO THE CODE-EXECUTING ENGINE SHOULD WORK ASYNCHRONOUS THIS WAY:

STEP 1: USER SUBMITS THE CODE I IMMEDIATLY SAVE A SUBMISSION RECORD WITH THE PENDING STATUS AND RETURN A 202 RESPONSE TO THE FRONT-END.
STEP 2: WE USE A LARAVEL JOB, FOR EXAMPLE EXECUTECODEJOB (THIS LARAVEL JOB IT'S GOING TO RUN IN THE BACKGROUND WITHOUT INTERFERING ANYTHING BETWEEN THE FRONT-END AND THE BACK-END)
STEP 3: WHEN THE JOB FINISHES WE USE LARAVEL REVERB (WEB SOCKETS) TO BROADCAST AN EVENT, THE EVENT BROADCASTS, THE FRONT-END LISTENS FOR THIS EVENT 
        AND THEN SHOWS THE RESULT DIRECTLY TO THE USER JUST AFTER THE JOB FINISHED.
STEP 4: USING QUEUES - FOR EXAMPLE IN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM LET'S SAY WE HAVE 10 TEST CASES, I SPLIT THOSE TEST CASES IN 10 DIFFERENT JOBS
    THEN I WILL HAVE SOME WORKER PROCESSES RUNNING, THOSE TEST CASES WILL BE EXECUTED IN PARALLEL, FINISHING FASTER THAN USUAL. SO JUST USING PARALELISM
    TO EXECUTE THE JOBS IN PARALEL TO EACH OTHER SO THE TEST-CASES RUN FASTER.


NOW WE HAVE THE ACTUAL STEPS TO FINALIZE (BUILD THIS):

1.CREATE A PARTICULAR JOB.
2.CREATE THE SOCKET CONNECTION.
3.CREATE THE LOGIC TO RUN THE CODE ON THE BACKGROUND.
4.CREATE THE LOGIC AFTER THE CODE RUNS TO ACTUALLY BROADCAST AN EVENT AND UPDATE THE DATABASE FOR THAT PARTICULAR SUBMISSION.
