GAMIFY SYSTEM PLANNING:

1.FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO GAMIFY THIS SYSTEM SO THE USERS CAN ACTUALLY EARN POINTS (OR COINS THROUGH THIS SYSTEM)
2.THE REASON WHY I REALLY WANT TO GAMIFY THIS SYSTEM IT'S TO KEEP THE USERS ENGAGED AND TO KEEP THE USERS KIND OF "STUCK" IN OUR PLATFORM 
3.THE MORE THE USERS (STUDENTS) STAY IN THIS PLATFORM THE MORE WE WIN
4.FIRST OF ALL THE GAMIFIED SYSTEM IT'S GOING TO WORK LIKE THIS
    WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SOURCE WHERE WE WILL BE GETTING THE POINTS WHICH THE USER HAS EARNED UP-UNTIL NOW
    THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME ACTIONS THAT WILL ACTUALLY NEED THOSE POINTS TO BE PERFORMED
    FOR EACH ACTION WE WILL HAVE AN ENDPOINT WHICH IT'S GOING TO BE EXECUTED SO WE CREATE THE MIDDLEWARE WHICH WE WILL NAME IT
    SOMETHING LIKE THIS:"coins.required" THIS MIDDLEWARE WILL HAVE SOME PARAMETER WHICH PARAMETER WILL BE THE NUMBER OF COINS REQUIRED TO PERFORM
    THAT PARTICULAR ACTION, IF THE USER PASSES THE NUMBER OF COINS REQUIRED WE ACTUALLY ALLOW THE MIDDLEWARE TO PASS AND WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
    COINS FROM THE USER.BASED ON HOW MANY COINS THAT ACTION COSTED.
    THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME ACTIONS THAT ACTUALLY WIN COINS FOR USERS,WE CREATE SOME EVENTS AND THEN WHEN THE USER DOES SOME PARTICULAR
    ACTION WE EXECUTE THOSE EVENTS, THE EXECUTION OF THE EVENTS THEN GOES ON AND UPDATES THE DATABASE (THE RESOURCE SO THE PART WHERE WE ARE SAVING THE COINS)
    
    // SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALSO SOME EVENT-LISTENERS
    // SO BASICLLY IN EACH RULE THAT WE HAVE IN THE DATABASE
    // WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE "event_id" or EVENT NAME
    // WHICH WE CAN GET THE RULES WHEN THAT EVENT REALLY HAPPENDS

    SO BASICLLY I SHOULD BUILD A SYSTEM WHERE EACH REWARDING FEELS LIKE
    PERSONALIZED REWARDING BECAUSE IN THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM WHERE REWARDINGS MATTER A LOT 
    WE SHOULD HAVE PERSONALIZED REWARDS, SO FIRST OF ALL DECIDE WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO GET USER'S REWARDS.

    SO THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE IT'S THIS:
        HOW DO WE FIND THE BEST "INTERN" FOR COMPANIES, OUR PLATFORM SHOULD NOT BE DESIGNED WITH JUST A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR COMPANIES
        OUR PLATFORM SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO TEST STUDENTS ON WHICH ONE OF THEM WOULD BE A RIGHT FIT FOR AN INTERNSHIP,
        SO IN OUR PLATFORM WE SHOULD HAVE A GAMIFIED SYSTEM WHICH IT'S CORRELATED OR LINKED TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE STUDENTS
        WE NEED TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE BEHAVIOR OF THE STUDENTS THAT USUALLY WOULD WORK WELL IN AN INTERNSHIP
        SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I COULD GAMIFY FOR THE USERS:
            1.COMPLETING TASKS BEFORE THE DEADLINES (THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO JUST RANDOMLY GIVE TASKS TO USERS WITH A DEADLINE AND THEN BASED ON HOW HE PERFORMED
            OUR GAMIFYING ENGINE GIVES HIM THE PARTICULAR COIN OR NOT) ( SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE COIN-TYPES )
            2.MAINTAINING WEEKLY-ACTIVITY STREAKS ( BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY FORCED TO COME IN THERE THIS PLATFORM SHOULD NOT BE TIRING IT SHOULD BE HELPFUL )
            3.FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ( SO THEY WILL HAVE COINS ALSO JUST BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF US )
            4.THEN WHEN WE GO TO THE SKILL-BASED THINGS, WE NEED TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE USERS SKILL-BASED CHALLENGES (CODING TASKS,CASE STUDIES,DESIGN BRIEFS)
            5.THE GAMIFYING ENGINE IT'S GOING TO GIVE COINS AND POINTS NOT ONLY BASED ON HOW THEY PERFORM CONSISTENTLY ON A PARTICULAR TASK, BUT ALSO HOW THEY 
            REACT TO A CHANGE,FOR EXAMPLE IF HE COMPLETES THE SAME TYPE OF CHALLENGE 10 TIMES HE IS NOT GOING TO GET 10 TIMES THE SAME AMOUNT OF COINS
            ALWAYS GETTING LESS AND LESS COINS.
            6.MOTIVATION & CURIOSITY SIGNALS (WHAT THINGS OR WHAT KNOWLEDGE DO THEY HAVE REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE THINGS THEY LEARN IN UNIVERSITY SO THERE WILL BE A COIN TYPE FOR THAT ALSO)
            

            WHAT TO NOT REWARD STUDENTS FOR:
                1.RAW PAGE VIEWS
                2.CLICKING EVERYTHING (SO NOT FOR JUST SOME PARTICULAR SIMPLE CLICKS TO REWARD THE USERS)
                3.REPEATING THE SAME ACTIONS OVER AND OVER ( FOR EXAMPLE DO NOT REWARD HIM IF HE KEEPS ACTUALLY REPEATING THE SAME CHALLENGE/TASK TO GET JUST REWARD )
            
            FEATURE IDEA WOULD BE THAT COMPANIES COULD PROPOSE A PARTICULAR PROJECT,
            THEN THE STUDENTS CAN COMPETE FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT,AND THEY CAN SUBMIT ONLY AND ONLY IF THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF COINS
            AND THE COMPANY COULD ACTUALLY REVIEW THE 10 PROJECTS THAT WERE GIVEN FROM THE MOST ACTIVE ONES IN THE PLATFORM.

            IF AN ACTION DOES NOT GENERATE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE,IT SHOULD NOT GENERATE COINS.
