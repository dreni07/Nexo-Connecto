so first of all what I need to do about the profile
I need to get the neccessary data like the username,email,role
and also the university details where the user it's, once i get the university details,
where the user it's I can immediatly fill-out the subjects the user it's taking and based on the subjects
the user it's taking then I have a lot of data for the user,
I can make then the user jump straight into the platform, after the user jumps straight into the platforms
I will gamify the process of completing the profile, where I will show a percentage of completion
I will show all the other steps to complete the profile on small modular cards,
for example I will not show forms but actions, for example Add Internships,
Add GPA,Add This, Add That etc,etc.
then I will also make sure that the users for example where they have to write
their career goals, I will display an input with some friendly message like:"Tell us
more about your career goals"
